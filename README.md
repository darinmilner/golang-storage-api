Remote Storage Microservice APP.
It is set up to connect to Minio and AWS S3 buckets.
I am still working on the S3 code and Handlers.
It will return JSON back to the frontend. GRPC maybe added to connect
with other backend services
It can be set up with PostgresDB or MariaDB.
Docker-compose is set up with Docker secrets for PostgresDB
